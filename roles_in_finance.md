# Roles in the Finance

A simple mind map for me to understand what people are doing in NYC.

## Sellside

1. Front office
    - Bankers: Two major businesses: M&A (0.5-5% transaction fees) and IPO (2-7% transaction fees). Basically sales trying to sell companies.
    - Traders: They trade equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives, and more. Some functions: 1) Market Making 2)Proprietary Trading 3) Execution. automated already. Pricing is a huge topic for infrequently traded securities.
    - Researcher: ofc not sexy AI research lol. these are equity research ppl trying to understand the market. Instead they publish reports on what to sell and buy.

2. Middle office
    - Risk Management: def replacable.

3. Back office
    - Operating
    - Accounting / Auditing

IMO, other than bankers and sales, all other functionalities could be replaced by AI eventually. Maybe not completely, but very likely.

## Buyside

Buyside are just capital willing to offer

1. Hedge Funds: Active Investment. More aggressive, and less regulated. Categories:
    - By investment approach and underlying strategy: fundamental or quant or systematic.
        - Market-neutral funds aim to eliminate market risk by maintaining equal long and short positions in a specific sector, industry, or index, including, fixed Income Arbitrage
        - Global macro hedge funds focus on making bets on macroeconomic trends, such as interest rates, inflation, currency movements, and political events. etc. Bridgewater, soros etc.
        - Systematic and automated, often trading at high frequencies or using machine learning techniques to refine their strategies.
    - By asset class: long/short equities, FIX, REPO, futures etc.
2. Asset Managers: mainly passive. could be active too. pension funds etc.
3. Ventrue Capital: by different sectors.
4. Private Equity: They buy or finance small, growing companies.
