# Roles in the Finance

A simple mind map for me to understand what people are doing in NYC.

## Sellside

1. Front office
    - Bankers: Two major businesses: M&A (0.5-5% transaction fees) and IPO (2-7% transaction fees). Basically sales trying to sell companies.
    - Traders: They trade equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives, and more. Some functions: 1) Market Making 2)Proprietary Trading 3) Execution. automated already. Pricing is a huge topic for infrequently traded securities.
    - Researcher: ofc not sexy AI research lol. these are equity research ppl trying to understand the market. Instead they publish reports on what to sell and buy.

2. Middle office
    - Risk Management: def replacable.

3. Back office
    - Operating
    - Accounting / Auditing

IMO, other than bankers and sales, all other functionalities could be replaced by AI eventually. Maybe not completely, but very likely.

## Buyside

Buyside funds are capitals willing to own or finance companies. Pre IPO / ICO stages, it's all VC game.

In public markets, you could categorized funds by 1) source of capital, PE/Pension funds etc 2) investment obejectives. like growth, income, balanced, EST etc. 3) asset class: equity, FIX, real estate, commodity, or a mix etc. 4) investment approach: active (hedge funds), passive (Asset managers, ETF, index funds)

- Hedge Funds: Active Investment. Alpha seeking. More aggressive, and less regulated. Asset class varies. By investment approach and underlying strategy:
    - fundamental: 1) global macro hedge funds focus on making bets on macroeconomic trends, such as interest rates, inflation, currency movements, and political events. etc. Bridgewater, soros etc. 2) could also be event-driven. like market-neutral funds aim to eliminate market risk by maintaining equal long and short positions in a specific sector, industry, or index, including, fixed Income Arbitrage.
    - systematic: HFT. often trading at high frequencies or using machine learning techniques to refine their strategies.
    These days, all funds use a mixture of both fundamental and quant methods.
- Asset Managers: Beta seeking. Less aggressive. Index or ETF.
